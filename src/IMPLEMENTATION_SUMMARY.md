## 🔧 How to Use

### Quick Start (Recommended):

Replace your `renderServicesTab()` function in GuestApp.tsx with:

```typescript
import { ServicesTab } from './ServicesTab';

const renderServicesTab = () => {
  return (
    <ServicesTab 
      onNavigateToService={(service) => {
        if (service === 'ai-concierge') setCurrentScreen('ai-concierge');
        if (service === 'hotel-directory') setCurrentScreen('hotel-directory');
        if (service === 'virtual-tour') setCurrentScreen('virtual-tour');
      }}
      onServiceRequest={(category, service) => {
        console.log(`Request: ${category} - ${service}`);
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

### Alternative: Direct Map Integration

Use `<InteractiveHotelMap />` anywhere you need just the map:

```typescript
<InteractiveHotelMap 
  onNavigateToService={(service) => {
    // Handle navigation to dining, spa, transport, etc.
  }}
/>
```
